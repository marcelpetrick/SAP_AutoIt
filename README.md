# SAP_AutoIt
A little helper to automate the annoying data-input.
It requires a running and open Chrome-tab with the SAP-tab for "RÃ¼ckmeldung" of the current project.
Inserts two lines of data automatically. Slow, because SAP reacts slow as well ;)

Planned are features like totally coordinate-independent input (currently just the top-left as reference-point is found by image-search).
